* My Emacs Config

  This is my emacs configuration.

  If you're interested in using it, please first consider using it as
  a source of inspiration first. Check out =spacemacs= and
  =layers/keybindings= for the most interesting and unusual bits.

* Installing

  Setting up this config for your own use is fairly simple:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd $HOME
    git clone https://github.com/jcpetkovich/.emacs.d.git ~/.spacemacs.d
    emacs --batch -l ~/.spacemacs.d/spacemacs
#+END_SRC

=spacemacs= is both the config and a script for bootstrapping both
=~/.emacs.d/= with [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]], and for any external spacemacs layers
used.

Some other dependencies you may want to install:

- `slime` (through [quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/))
- `mu4e` (through your package manager)
- `ghc-mod` (through your package manager, or [cabal](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/))
- `jedi` (through your package manager, [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) or similar)

If you don't want the functionality of these particluar packages, you
may ignore them, as the configuration should run without them.

* Significant Keybindings

The defaults for emacs/evil are used wherever possible, the following
sections document significant alterations or interesting pieces not
included in emacs by default.

For more general help, To show every custom custom binding just run
`M-x describe-personal-keybindings`. To see an interactive and
searchable list of any active keybindings in the current buffer, run
`C-h b`.

To understand these keybindings you must understand the emacs
[keybinding notation](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsKeyNotation).
